Here are some issues that i've encountered while setting up the game so far
If you guys have any free time, I would really appreciate if you could help me solve some of these issues

1. walls not working - fixed !!
    - if you move our main character behind or under the npc it looks weird - i think the wall around the npc hasnt been properly defined
2. Main character still moves even if text is there - the character shouldnt move even when arrows are pressed
3. The Main character has to go very close to interact with another character
4. the npc going in circles on the second floor can be walked through - like there is no wall around it 
    - this actually happens after talking to it 
5. The starting text comes up twice - fixed !!
    - idk why it says "Hello WorldHello World" - it's supposed to say "Hello World" only
